# Info
# Due to GitHubs truncation at 1000 items, I had to split this projects directory into 17 parts.
# In the original, 1-100 and all other labeled directories in this format didn't exist, all 1700 folders were in the root of the directory.
# The `IGNORE.md` files didn't exist either, they were added due to not being able to upload blank directories to GitHub.
